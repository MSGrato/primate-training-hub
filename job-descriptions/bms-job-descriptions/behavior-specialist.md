## Position Summary

The Washington National Primate Research Center (WaNPRC) at the University of Washington seeks a dedicated Behavior Specialist to join our Behavioral Management Program. The Behavior Specialist is responsible for monitoring, assessing, and enhancing the psychological well-being of nonhuman primates (NHPs) housed at the center. This role combines behavioral observation, environmental enrichment, and positive reinforcement training to ensure the highest standards of animal welfare in compliance with federal regulations, AAALAC guidelines, and institutional policies.

## Essential Duties and Responsibilities

- Conduct daily behavioral assessments of NHP colonies, identifying signs of abnormal, stereotypic, or distressed behavior and implementing appropriate interventions.
- Design, implement, and evaluate environmental enrichment programs tailored to species-specific behavioral needs, including foraging devices, manipulanda, social housing configurations, and sensory enrichment.
- Develop and carry out positive reinforcement training (PRT) programs to facilitate voluntary participation in husbandry and veterinary procedures, reducing the need for physical restraint.
- Maintain detailed behavioral records, enrichment logs, and training progress reports; enter data into institutional databases in a timely and accurate manner.
- Collaborate with veterinary staff, animal care technicians, and research teams to develop individualized behavioral management plans for animals with special needs or behavioral concerns.
- Assist with social introductions and pair/group housing efforts to promote species-appropriate social behavior and comply with federal psychological well-being regulations.
- Evaluate and recommend new enrichment strategies based on current literature, attend professional development opportunities, and present findings to internal and external audiences.
- Participate in IACUC protocol reviews as a behavioral resource and contribute to standard operating procedures (SOPs) related to behavioral management.
- Support research activities by providing behavioral expertise, including ethogram development, behavioral coding, and inter-observer reliability assessments as needed.
- Ensure compliance with all applicable federal (USDA, PHS Policy), state, and institutional regulations governing the care and use of laboratory animals.

## Minimum Qualifications

- Bachelor's degree in animal behavior, psychology, biology, primatology, zoology, or a closely related field.
- Minimum of two (2) years of experience working directly with nonhuman primates in a research, zoological, or sanctuary setting.
- Demonstrated experience with positive reinforcement training and behavioral modification techniques for NHPs.
- Strong observational skills and proficiency in behavioral data collection methods (e.g., focal sampling, scan sampling, all-occurrence recording).
- Proficiency in Microsoft Office Suite and data management tools; experience with behavioral coding software (e.g., BORIS, Noldus Observer) is preferred.
- Excellent written and verbal communication skills with the ability to work collaboratively in a multidisciplinary team environment.

## Preferred Qualifications

- Master's degree in a relevant discipline.
- Certification as an Applied Animal Behaviorist (CAAB or ACAAB) or equivalent professional credential.
- Experience with multiple NHP species (e.g., Macaca mulatta, Macaca nemestrina, Macaca fascicularis, Papio spp.).
- Familiarity with AAALAC International accreditation standards and USDA Animal Welfare Act regulations.
- Experience contributing to peer-reviewed publications or professional conference presentations.
- Working knowledge of statistical analysis software (e.g., R, SPSS, JMP) for behavioral data analysis.

## Working Conditions

- Work is performed in vivarium and laboratory environments with exposure to nonhuman primates, biological materials, allergens, and zoonotic agents.
- Must be able to lift up to 50 pounds, stand for extended periods, and work in varying environmental conditions (temperature, noise, humidity).
- Enrollment in the Occupational Health and Safety Program is required, including tuberculosis (TB) screening and measles immunity verification.
- May require occasional weekend, holiday, or evening work to meet animal care and training schedules.
- Personal protective equipment (PPE) must be worn at all times while working with animals.
