## Position Summary

The Washington National Primate Research Center (WaNPRC) at the University of Washington is seeking a skilled Training Specialist to join the Behavioral Management Program. The Training Specialist is responsible for developing, implementing, and overseeing positive reinforcement training (PRT) programs for nonhuman primates (NHPs) housed at the center. This role focuses on training animals to voluntarily cooperate with husbandry, veterinary, and research procedures, thereby reducing stress, improving animal welfare, and enhancing the quality of scientific data. The Training Specialist also serves as a key resource for educating staff across departments in humane and effective animal training techniques.

## Essential Duties and Responsibilities

- Design and implement positive reinforcement training programs to facilitate voluntary cooperation with routine husbandry procedures (e.g., shifting, stationing, crate training) and veterinary procedures (e.g., venipuncture, injection, visual health checks).
- Develop and maintain individualized training plans for NHPs based on species, temperament, behavioral history, and research requirements; adjust approaches as needed to achieve training goals.
- Train animals to cooperate with research-specific procedures as requested by investigators, working closely with research teams to understand protocol requirements and timelines.
- Create and deliver training workshops, instructional materials, and hands-on mentoring sessions for animal care staff, veterinary technicians, and research personnel on PRT principles and techniques.
- Maintain comprehensive and accurate training records, including session logs, progress notes, shaping plans, and outcome metrics; enter data into institutional tracking systems in a timely manner.
- Evaluate training program effectiveness using quantitative and qualitative metrics; prepare periodic reports and recommend improvements based on data analysis and current best practices.
- Collaborate with the Behavioral Management team to integrate training programs with broader enrichment and behavioral assessment efforts, ensuring a cohesive approach to animal welfare.
- Assist with socialization efforts, including pair and group introductions, using training techniques to facilitate safe and successful social housing outcomes.
- Stay current with developments in animal learning theory, operant conditioning, and applied behavior analysis as they relate to NHP management; attend and present at professional conferences and workshops.
- Contribute to the development and revision of standard operating procedures (SOPs) related to NHP training; serve as a training resource for IACUC protocol reviews.
- Identify and address behavioral challenges that may impede training progress, including fear responses, aggression, and stereotypic behavior, through evidence-based intervention strategies.
- Ensure all training activities comply with federal (USDA, PHS Policy), state, and institutional regulations and AAALAC International accreditation standards.

## Minimum Qualifications

- Bachelor's degree in animal behavior, psychology, biology, zoology, or a closely related field.
- Minimum of two (2) years of hands-on experience training nonhuman primates using positive reinforcement techniques in a research, zoological, or sanctuary setting.
- Demonstrated proficiency in operant conditioning principles, shaping, desensitization, and counter-conditioning methods.
- Strong ability to read and interpret NHP body language, vocalizations, and behavioral cues to ensure safe and effective training interactions.
- Excellent organizational skills with experience maintaining detailed training records and documentation.
- Effective written and verbal communication skills with the ability to teach and mentor staff at all experience levels.
- Proficiency in Microsoft Office Suite; familiarity with electronic training record systems or databases.

## Preferred Qualifications

- Master's degree in applied behavior analysis, animal behavior, or a related discipline.
- Certification as a Certified Professional Dog Trainer (CPDT-KA), Certified Applied Animal Behaviorist (CAAB/ACAAB), or Board Certified Behavior Analyst (BCBA), or equivalent professional credential demonstrating expertise in applied learning principles.
- Experience training multiple NHP species (e.g., Macaca mulatta, Macaca nemestrina, Macaca fascicularis, Papio spp.) for a variety of husbandry, veterinary, and research procedures.
- Experience developing and delivering formal training curricula or educational programming for staff.
- Familiarity with AAALAC International accreditation standards, USDA Animal Welfare Act regulations, and the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals.
- Experience contributing to peer-reviewed publications, professional presentations, or training-related workshops at national or international conferences.
- Working knowledge of behavioral data analysis tools or statistical software (e.g., R, SPSS, JMP, Excel).

## Working Conditions

- Work is performed primarily in vivarium and animal housing environments with direct daily contact with nonhuman primates, biological materials, allergens, and potential zoonotic agents.
- Must be able to lift up to 50 pounds, stand and move for extended periods, and work in varying environmental conditions including temperature fluctuations, noise, and humidity.
- Enrollment in the Occupational Health and Safety Program is required, including tuberculosis (TB) screening, measles immunity verification, and participation in the medical surveillance program.
- May require occasional weekend, holiday, or evening work to accommodate training schedules, animal care needs, or research timelines.
- Personal protective equipment (PPE) must be worn at all times while working in animal areas in accordance with institutional biosafety protocols.
